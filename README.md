# Inbound-Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis
## 1. Project Description:
This project delves into Customer Experience (CX) analytics, specifically focusing on inbound calling teams within a company.
Using a dataset spanning 23 days, it examines details like agent information, call queue times, call durations, and call statuses (abandoned, answered, or transferred).
The aim is to derive insights to enhance customer support and satisfaction. In today's landscape, AI-powered tools like IVR, RPA, Predictive Analytics, and Intelligent Routing are leveraged to
augment customer experiences. The project underscores the pivotal role of call centre agents in providing excellent customer support, with a focus on handling incoming calls to foster customer
satisfaction and loyalty.
 ## 2. Approach:
### Data Understanding:
* I have begun by thoroughly examining the dataset provided. Understand the structure of the data, including the columns and their meanings.
### Calculated all the task
* Calculated the all the given task and generated some insights which are helpful for company
### Documentation and Reporting:
* At last I have created the report telling information and the snapshot of each task
 ## 3. Tech-Stack Used: 
* In this project, Microsoft Excel 2010 was used primarily for data analysis and visualization. The purpose of using Excel 2010 was to leverage its familiar interface. 
Overall, Microsoft Excel 2010 served as a versatile and accessible tool for conducting data analysis and visualization.
 ## 4. Insights:

### A) Average Call Duration
* An Overall Increasing Trend from 9am to 9pm with average duration of 198.62 seconds
* lowest during 12pm to 1pm which is 192.88
* Longest duration during 7pm to 8pm which is 203.406

### B) Call Volume Analysis:
* Highest call received at 11am to 12pm bucket is 14626
* Lowest call received at 8pm to 9pm bucket is 5505.

### C) Manpower Planning:
* Highest call received at 11am to 12pm bucket is 14626
* Lowest call received at 8pm to 9pm bucket is 5505.

### Assumption: 
 An agent work for 6 days a week; on an average total unplanned leaves per agent is 4 days a month; an agent total working hrs. Are 9 Hrs. out of which 1.5 Hrs. goes into lunch and snacks in the office? On average an agent occupied for 60% of his total actual working Hrs. (i.e. 60% of 7.5 Hrs.) on call with customers/ users. Total days in a month are 30 days.
So the following snapshot shows that the agents required in each time bucket

## 5.Result:
* 9am-12pm slot received highest calls and also have the highest call abandoned rate company should use the man power planning in each time bucket and reduce it to 10% 
* Man power planning will help to manage the agents and ultimately reduce call abandonment rate and improve customer experience. 
* This will help to attract, engage, and delight customers, turning them into loyal advocates for the business
